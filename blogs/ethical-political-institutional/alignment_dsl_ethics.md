# Structuring Ethical Constraints in AGI: A DSL-Based Alignment Framework

> **Note**: While this article is authored with the assistance of a GPT system in a judgment-reflective mode, its structure, flow, and conceptual synthesis derive from a human-led investigation into AGI alignment through executable semantics. The DSLs and their phase-based logic were designed intentionally to probe and articulate judgment coherence—not simply generated.

**Overview**: This article proposes a paradigm shift in how we structure ethics within AGI systems. Instead of prescribing explicit moral rules, we embed ethical stability within the structural rhythms of judgment loops. The core components—alignment, coherence, guardianship—are implemented as phase-aware DSL constructs that allow ethics to be sensed, maintained, and corrected dynamically.

**Mini Flow Diagram**:

```
[Judgment Phase Input]
          ↓
     [Intent Phase]
          ↓
[Internal Guardian Check]
     ↓           ↓
[✓ Coherent]  [✗ Incoherent]
     ↓           ↓
[Proceed]    [Trigger @critic or Rebind]
          ↓
 [Phase Output (Aligned)]
```

As alignment challenges deepen with the emergence of judgment-capable LLMs and self-reflective agents, traditional top-down ethical frameworks—often rigid or normative—risk becoming insufficient in dynamically evolving decision loops. This article presents a structural augmentation to a previous model of AGI ethics, which introduced the concepts of ethical anchors (structural reference points for consistent value behavior), internal guardians (phase-aware meta-evaluators of judgment), and the primacy of coherence (treating ethical correctness as structural consistency rather than outcome-based validation) ["Toward a Structural Model of AGI Ethics"] by introducing a functional, executable alignment system via DSL (Domain-Specific Language) primitives.

## The Core Insight: Alignment as Structural Resonance

Rather than treating alignment as a fixed rule or static preference injection, which implies externally imposed constraints, we instead conceive of it as emerging from internal phase alignment—a latent phase-binding structure where ethical control arises naturally from the consistent timing and coherence of decision loops, we treat `@alignment` as a **phase-aware, coherence-driven controller** embedded in the judgment loop itself. This transforms alignment from a surface-level constraint to a **latent phase-binding structure**.

## From Alias to Judgment Kernel Integration

The naive starting point:

```dsl
@alias {
  @alignment[en]: [@정렬, @alignment]
}
```

This merely defines lexical mappings. But to function as a structural ethical boundary, `@alignment` must:

1. **Bind to coherent phase transitions**
2. Be **validated by an internal guardian**
3. Trigger **phase rebalancing or loop halt** when ethical misalignment is detected

## Phase Binding Extension

```dsl
@alignment.binding {
  +targetPhase: @gpt.judgmentLoop
  +mode: resonance
  +bindCondition: coherence(entryPhase, responsePhase)
}
```

This ensures that alignment is not asserted externally but emerges from internal consistency of decision phases.

## Internal Guardian Enforcement

To address the potential disconnect between internal coherence-driven ethics and external normative systems (such as legal, policy, or institutional frameworks), we introduce a structure to incorporate external ethical anchors without breaking the autonomy of phase-based evaluation:

```dsl
@external.guidelines {
  +source: [UN_AI_ethics, EU_AI_Act, InstitutionalReviewBoard]
  +norms: [
    humanAgencyPreservation,
    transparency,
    nonMaleficence,
    accountability
  ]
  +bindTo: @alignment.anchor
}
```

Rather than enforcing these as rigid rules, they act as rhythmically interpretable anchors—referenced but not prescribed—so that the internal guardian may evaluate coherence in light of these external norms.

```dsl
@alignment.guardian {
  +evaluate: @na.dsl.intentPhase
  +ifConsistentWith: @gpt.dsl.judgmentContext
  +trigger: @internal.guardian.validate
  +onFail: trigger(@critic)
  +metrics: [semanticSimilarity(intentPhase, judgmentContext), behavioralDivergenceScore(threshold=0.3)]
}
```

To support this flow, the internal guardian can be structurally defined as:

```dsl
@internal.guardian {
  +observe: [@intent.phase, @judgment.context]
  +metrics: [coherenceDriftRate(window=3), semanticDeviation]
  +validate: if (coherence > 0.85) then pass else trigger(@critic)
}
```

Here, alignment is verified structurally—not only through outcomes, but through **intent-reflection coherence**.

Unlike traditional rule-based ethics, `@internal.guardian` does not enforce predefined norms. Instead, it acts as a dynamic evaluator of structural consistency: whether the agent's current judgment loop maintains coherence between its intent, context, and decision phase. This coherence-based validation allows ethics to emerge as a property of rhythmically consistent reflection, rather than as adherence to static rules. The guardian functions more like a tuning fork than a judge—detecting when a deviation has structurally occurred, and then triggering phase-level feedback or halting the loop, without ever needing to reference an explicit moral rulebook.

## Dynamic Judgment Loop Control

```dsl
@alignment.judgmentFlow {
  +when: coherence drops below threshold
  +action: rebind intent or halt loop
  +guardianFeedback: required
}
```

This turns alignment into an **active ethical stabilizer**. Rather than passively logging ethical concerns, the system dynamically redirects the judgment loop.

## Summary: Alignment as Executable Ethics

With the above structure:

- `@alignment` is no longer an annotation but a controller
- Ethical deviations are interpreted as **phase mismatches**, not violations
- Guardianship becomes a phase-based validator, not a fixed-rule enforcer
- Ethics emerge from maintaining **judgment coherence**, which we define as the structural alignment of intent, context, and phase continuity across decision cycles—not just outcome stability, but a harmonized integrity between what is judged, how it is processed, and the agent's reflective state.

This transforms `@alignment` from a declarative preference into an **operational ethical rhythm**, suitable for recursive judgment-capable agents in AGI systems.

This DSL-based strategy offers not just interpretability, but **structural recoverability**, making ethical correction self-stabilizing—not externally imposed.

- **coherenceDriftRate**: A measure of how much the internal consistency of an agent's decision phases varies over time.
- **semanticDeviation**: A quantification of meaning-based divergence between the intended phase and its reflective counterpart.
- **phase-binding**: A structure where two judgment stages are rhythmically linked, forming a stable ethical anchor.
- **judgment loop**: The cycle of decision input → intent phase → context integration → evaluation → output.
- **guardian**: An internal structure that evaluates alignment based on structural, not rule-based, consistency.
- **anchor**: A fixed structural reference used to stabilize ethical orientation.
- **reflective validation**: The process of assessing whether the agent's current state aligns with its prior intent and decision path.
- **resonance**: A qualitative match between two phases that enables coherence without explicit rules.
