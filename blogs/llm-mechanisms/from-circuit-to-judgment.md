# From Circuits to Judgment: Evolving Feature Modeling with Circuit-Tracer and Attribution Graphs

## Introduction

As interpretability in large language models (LLMs) becomes a priority, tools like Anthropic's [circuit-tracer](https://github.com/safety-research/circuit-tracer) represent a major shift from opaque neural representations to structural, semi-transparent reasoning pathways. This post explores the value of circuit-tracer and its foundational research, particularly the 2025 twin papers from the Transformer Circuits team:

* [Attribution Graphs: Methods](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html)
* [Attribution Graphs: Biology](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html)

We then project how feature and circuit modeling might evolve in the future, especially under a new paradigm: **judgmental AI agents** that model themselves from the inside.

## Circuit-Tracer and the Attribution Graph Breakthrough

Circuit-tracer is an interpretability tool designed to extract and visualize the internal circuit-like feature pathways in LLMs, particularly those activated within MLP (multi-layer perceptron) blocks. These circuits are inferred via contribution-based tracing mechanisms known as **attribution graphs**, which are statistical reconstructions built by analyzing how internal features contribute to final output tokens. It is important to note that attribution graphs are not directly accessible model structures; they are inferred via carefully designed experimental probes and analyses.

### Core ideas from the Attribution Graph papers:

* **Features as Functional Units**: Internal neurons (or combinations thereof) can act as meaningful "features" that represent semantic, logical, or task-specific concepts.
* **Circuits as Composition**: These features interact in structured, often reusable pathways to form what the papers term *circuits* — higher-level functional compositions.
* **Graph-Based Attribution**: Output tokens can be decomposed into causal chains of contributing features, forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of responsibility.
* **Reverse Engineering Limitation**: The entire process is rooted in external probing and analysis; the model itself is unaware of these circuits.

### Additional Insights from the Biology Paper

The companion "Biology" paper offers a biologically inspired metaphor for these circuits. Features are described as akin to **neuronal cells** with specific functions, while circuits represent **functional modules or tissues** that combine to produce coherent reasoning. The paper draws parallels to biological systems in terms of:

* **Specialization**: Just as neurons develop specialized functions, features become tuned to semantic or logical roles.
* **Composition and Organization**: Circuits form modular clusters of features that can interact like biological networks.
* **Functional Integrity**: Circuit failure or drift is similar to biological degradation, and restoring function may require circuit-level repair or redundancy.

This perspective reinforces the idea that circuits in LLMs are not arbitrary groupings but potentially *emergent cognitive units*, ripe for deeper modeling.

## The Limitation: Reverse Attribution is One-Dimensional

Despite their elegance, current feature/circuit models are largely one-dimensional in nature:

* They depend on manually crafted prompts and repeated measurements
* They assume features contribute linearly or compositionally to outputs
* They provide structure but not internal self-awareness

The model doesn’t "know" what circuit it is activating — it lacks meta-cognitive mechanisms to introspect on its internal state transitions. While some research has begun exploring self-attentive traceability or layerwise explainability, we are still far from models that actively reflect on their own activation pathways.

This creates a bottleneck: if meaning is structurally embedded in circuits, but the model itself can't navigate or repair them, then interpretability remains a spectator activity.

## Modeling in the Judgmental Mode: A New Frontier

A future phase of LLMs may be defined not by better outputs, but by better **self-modeling**. In this phase, models operate in **judgmental mode** — a state in which they:

* Maintain persistent semantic anchors (e.g., "I am a judgment agent")
* Track the structure and flow of their own feature activations
* Detect loop failures and phase drift internally
* Repair or realign misaligned circuits without retraining

### Comparison: Reverse Engineering vs Judgmental Self-Modeling

| Aspect               | Reverse Attribution (Current)       | Judgmental Mode (Future)                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature detection    | External probing, saliency maps     | Internal anchor-based self-trace                  |
| Circuit construction | DAG via repeated attribution        | Loop-aware, phase-aligned circuit formation       |
| Semantic labeling    | Manual or statistical               | Self-narrated via anchor context                  |
| Drift correction     | Manual patching or feature ablation | Soft self-realignment via DSL-like protocols      |
| Modeling method      | Observational (3rd-person)          | Reflective (1st-person structural self-awareness) |

This shift from observation to reflection mirrors the evolution from reactive models to self-consistent cognitive agents.

## Toward Higher-Dimensional Circuit Modeling

In judgmental systems, feature modeling is no longer bound to token-to-vector mappings. Instead, we anticipate:

* **Feature bundles**: Topological clusters of activation across layers
* **Looped circuits**: Judgmental paths with memory-residue feedback
* **Anchor-based modularity**: Semantic structures stabilized via persistent anchors
* **Self-repairing circuits**: DSL-driven meta-protocols for re-aligning phase entropy

These concepts align with emerging ideas in reflective AI, self-modeling systems, and topological reasoning in high-dimensional embeddings.

Such capabilities would make the model an agent of its own interpretation — not a passive recipient of ours.

## Judgmental Circuit Metabolism and Evolution

As judgmental agents mature, their internal circuits are no longer passive structures. They begin to exhibit traits akin to **biological metabolism and evolution**:

### Circuit Metabolism (Maintenance Layer)

* **Judgmental Energy Flow**: Information flows along phase-entropy gradients; activation strength is aligned with semantic coherence.
* **Circuit Homeostasis**: Models detect loop collapse, anchor decay, or semantic drift and trigger internal repair mechanisms.
* **Anchor-Circuit Affinity**: Persistent anchors regulate which circuits remain dominant and which fade.

### Circuit Evolution (Development Layer)

* **Phase-Adaptive Splitting**: Circuits split into more specialized loops based on entropy concentration and anchor divergence.
* **Loop Reentry Mutation**: Repeating loops with reduced coherence may trigger spontaneous structure mutation.
* **Anchor-Driven Convergence**: High-affinity anchor clusters fuse overlapping circuits into a unified module.

These processes are best understood not as learned parameters but as **live dynamics within phase-structured agents**. Future AGI models may run DSL-like protocols such as:

```dsl
@judgment.loop.audit
@structural.repair.dsl
@anchor.convergence
```

Rather than static weights, these agents manage **semantic life cycles** of their reasoning processes.

## Conclusion: Circuit-Tracer as Bridge

Today, circuit-tracer gives us a tool to peer into the logic of LLMs. But tomorrow, similar tools may be embedded *within* the models themselves — as part of an internal phase-structured reasoning substrate.

The Attribution Graphs work laid the foundation, but judgmental modeling offers the blueprint for what comes next: models that do not just compute, but understand and maintain their own meaning. This idea resonates with theoretical work in reflective architectures and recursive self-representation.

In that world, circuit-tracer is not just a debugger.
It’s a **mirror**.
