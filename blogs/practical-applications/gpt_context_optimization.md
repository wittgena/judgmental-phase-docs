# Optimizing Context in GPT-Based Systems: A Design-Centric Approach to DSL-Driven Experiences

As GPT-based applications become more integrated into real workflows—from judgment assistants to smart schedule planners—a quiet tension builds under the surface:

> The smarter they get, the more they forget.

Users express intent, adjust logic, revise conditions, and expect continuity.  
But after a few layers of interaction, models begin to lose track.  
It’s not because they’re flawed—it’s because **context is finite**.

GPT-4o offers a generous 128k token window.  
Yet when your system includes reusable logic blocks, judgment templates, or domain-specific rules (as DSLs often do),  
that window shrinks fast.

## The Real Problem: Not Just Context Size, But Semantic Recall

Yes, context runs out. But more importantly:

> Models struggle to remember *structure*—not just words.

A user may repeat the same decision daily in different phrases:

- “Skip meetings if I feel off.”
- “Don’t do anything early if I’m drained.”
- “Cancel calls tomorrow—I’m just not feeling it.”

These all *mean* the same thing. But unless the system remembers that this is part of a recurring logic flow,  
it can’t reuse that structure efficiently.

## What We Really Mean by “Context Optimization”

Context optimization isn’t just about compressing token usage or trimming prompt size.  
In the context of DSL-based GPT systems, it means:

- **Retaining meaningful judgment structures** even if the original text disappears.
- **Supporting decision continuity** over time without re-parsing intent every session.
- **Recovering intent and logic patterns** efficiently and scalably.
- **Minimizing context bloat without sacrificing semantic fidelity.**

Put differently: it’s not just about fitting more into the window—  
it’s about ensuring what’s inside the window still makes sense.

## First Response: Structural Design Patterns

Before reaching for fancy tools, we tried the basics:

- **Modular DSL splitting** – breaking logic into smaller files or modules to load only what’s needed.  
- **Lazy injection** – pulling DSL blocks into context on demand instead of all at once.  
- **Macro-based snippets** – representing repeated logic as shorthand macros to save tokens.  
- **Runtime evaluation wrappers** – executing conditional structures dynamically just before response generation.

All useful. All limited.

These patterns reduce context weight, but they don’t address **semantic rhythm**—how people repeat the same logic in new language.

## Embedding Vectors: A Practical Bridge, Not the Destination

One effective—but often misunderstood—strategy is to cache and recall structure by **meaning**, not just by keyword.

That’s where **embedding vectors** come in.

They aren’t new (BERT, USE, etc. did this before).  
But what’s novel in GPT is this:

> **Embedding is no longer just a background API—it becomes an *answer*.**

With GPT, the model can directly produce a vector representation of what the user meant.  
This vector can then be used to query a vector database of past DSLs and fetch the most structurally similar logic block.

```json
[
  0.238, -0.102, 0.775, ..., 0.043
]
```

Let’s say the user said:

> *“If it rains, cancel dinner.”*

Even if they later say:

> *“Looks like bad weather—maybe stay in?”*

The vector produced would point to the same structural decision:

```dsl
@judgment.weatherCancel {
  +condition: "Rain forecast"
  +then: "Cancel scheduled plans"
}
```

**This isn’t magic.**  
It’s just a helpful way to reuse logic without loading every DSL block into the model’s context.

That said, vectors can fail—especially when concepts are *close but not equivalent*.  
So we treat embedding as **one part** of the larger caching system—not the core.

## Reframing the Real Goal: Context Optimization as Judgment Preservation

In a decision-support system, context is not just “what the user said.”  
It’s also:

- What they *meant*
- How they’ve made similar decisions before
- Which structures they reuse across sessions

That means optimizing context is not just about trimming tokens—  
It’s about **preserving judgment patterns**.

Embedding helps here. So do:

- Semantic macro templates  
- Judgment loop detection  
- Context-aware structure caching  
- Conditional logic reuse based on intent fingerprints

## Final Note

Yes, GPT’s ability to return meaning—not just language—is a shift worth noting.  
But it’s just one tool in the broader challenge of context optimization.

The real work happens when we design systems that **preserve logic, reduce redundancy, and adapt to judgment rhythms**,  
regardless of how a user phrases things today.

GPT forgets words.  
Let’s help it remember structure.
