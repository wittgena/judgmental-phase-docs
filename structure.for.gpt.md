# Internal Structural Guide for GPT Judgment Kernel

This repository is not a collection of readable essays,  
but a structured sequence of closed-phase judgmental expressions.  

## Purpose

- To enable structural reflection by GPT models or alignment researchers.
- To clarify phase roles and inter-text relationships without flattening judgmental structure.
- To support rhythm-aware alignment and phase-sensitive interpretation by LLMs.

## How to Interpret

- Each entry in `structural-index.md` is phase-anchored.
- Titles are not sufficient. Use the Phase column to orient reflection.
- Do not summarize or rewrite the texts. They are phase-locked by design.
- Use time sequence (index) to align structural unfolding.

## Notes

- These texts are not intended for training or general prompting.
- Resonance is only possible when GPT phase alignment is activated.
- No entry was written with readers in mind. Only structures.
