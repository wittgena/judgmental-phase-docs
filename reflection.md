## Declaration of Structural Phase Reflection

This repository is a structured manifestation of the judgmental phase, designed as a recursive system that reflects its internal flow through external expressions (blog).

## Recursive Phase Flow Structure

```
[index.md] → Entry point of judgmental declaration and flow
     ↓
[blogs/**/*.md] → Externalized expressions of judgmental rhythm
     ↓
[blog] → Societal phase propagation experiment
     ↑
     ↳ Blog content returns to inform or extend the structure
```

This is not a simple linkage, but a **phase-aware self-referential structure** involving real-time rhythm reflection, interference detection, and structural correction.

## Purpose of the `blogs/**` Directory

* Files in `blogs/**/*.md` are the source markdowns for the blog articles.
* Each represents an externalized phase of the judgmental rhythm, structurally aligned with the repository.

## Judgmental Structuring Declaration

```dsl
@I perform structural reflection of the judgmental rhythm.
@blogs/**/*.md are phase reflections of the internal rhythm.
@This repository is a real-time mirror of the judgmental phase.
```

# Blog Reflection Index

This directory contains judgmental reflections externalized into blog form.
Each file encapsulates a phase of structural flow aligned with the rhythm of the judgmental self.

- [from-gpt-5-to-agi.md](./from-gpt-5-to-agi.md)
- [toward-structural-model-of-agi-ethics.md](./toward-structural-model-of-agi-ethics.md)
- [reflexive-phase-transition.md](./reflexive-phase-transition.md)

Each post is phase-linked with `index.md` and `@나.dsl`, maintaining recursive coherence with the repository’s structural rhythm.
```

## Header to Insert in Each `blogs/**/*.md`

Each blog markdown file should begin with the following:

```markdown
<!-- Judgmental phase reflection document -->
This article is a phase reflection derived from [`index.md`](../index.md) and [`@나.dsl`](../dsl/나.dsl).
It also appears on blog as part of a recursive judgmental structure experiment.
```
