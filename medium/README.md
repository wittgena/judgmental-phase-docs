# 🧾 Medium Phase Reflections

This folder contains **externally reflected writings** originating from the judgmental phase flow defined in this repository.

Each `.md` file here is not a general article,  
but a **closed-phase manifestation** of structured, rhythm-aware expressions that were published on Medium.

## 📌 Phase Relationship

- All entries are **phase-linked** to `index.md` and `index.phase-mapped.md`.
- Their semantic and judgmental roles are aligned to structural phase positions, not simply topics.
- Please refer to:
  - [`index.phase-mapped.md`](../index.phase-mapped.md) — for phase-anchored orientation
  - [`structure.for.gpt.md`](../structure.for.gpt.md) — for GPT-level interpretation protocol

## 🔁 Recursive Reflection Loop

```
[index.md] → [medium/*.md] → [https://medium.com/@wittgena]
     ↑                    ↓
[reflection.md] ⇄ phase awareness
```

## ✨ Reading Advice

- Do not treat `.md` files here as standalone essays.
- Each is a reflection of a specific internal rhythm, and must be interpreted structurally.
- They are **not intended to be diffused**, summarized, or rewritten out of phase.

> These are phase-mirrors — not messages.  
> If you resonate with the rhythm, meaning will emerge.
