## 1. GPT is Not Just a Responder — It Needs Structure to Think

Most LLM applications are still simple: you give a prompt, it gives a response — and the loop ends there. But what if we give GPT a structure to reflect, revise, and re-enter a thought loop?

This article proposes a shift: treating GPT not as a responder but as a **thinking orchestrator**, enabled by a **DAG-based DSL**.

## 2. What is the +dag DSL?

The DAG-based DSL (Directed Acyclic Graph) defines a structured reasoning flow using composable components. Here's a breakdown of key keywords:

| DSL Keyword       | Description                                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `+dag`            | Declares the task flow with structure and metadata              |
| `flowEntry`       | Entry point to the reasoning process                            |
| `steps`           | Execution units (each step includes `id`, `runner`, `desc`)     |
| `+intuition`      | Hypothetical direction or instinct to test                      |
| `+val`            | Evaluation of the intuition or result                           |
| `+critic`         | Reflection on flaws, logic gaps, or flow inconsistencies        |
| `+reason`         | Natural language explanation of why a step or path was taken    |
| `+fallback`       | Backup path if a step fails                                     |
| `+retry`          | Retry logic trigger when uncertainty or failure occurs          |
| `+judge` / `+halt`| Flow termination or branching condition declaration              |
| `@gpt.entropy`    | Detects ambiguity or divergence — measures semantic entropy     |

## 3. GPT Thought Loop (ASCII Visualization)

```text
                   +--------------+
                   |  +intuition  |
                   | (hypothesis) |
                   +------+-------+
                          |
                          v
                   +------+-------+
                   |    +val      |
                   | (evaluate)   |
                   +------+-------+
                          |
                          v
                   +------+-------+
                   |   +critic     |
                   | (reflect)     |
                   +------+-------+
                          |
                          v
                   +------+-------+
                   |    +dag       |
                   | (act/execute)|
                   +------+-------+
                          |
                +---------+----------+
                |                    |
                v                    v
         +-------------+      +-------------+
         | +retry      |      | +fallback   |
         | (retry path)|      | (backup path)|
         +-------------+      +-------------+
                          \
                           \
                          @gpt.entropy
                        (detect stepwise semantic spikes)
```

### Example `@gpt.entropy` Output

```
Entropy across the DAG:
- step 1 (summarize): 0.31
- step 2 (critic): 0.35
- step 3 (fix_flow): 0.78 ← semantic uncertainty
- step 4 (compose_final): 0.36

➡ GPT recommends inserting +critic at step 3
```

This structure turns GPT from a static answer engine into a **reflective, recursive reasoning agent**.

## 4. Real Examples: Natural Language → DSL → GPT Execution

### Blog Summarization and Flow Refinement Example

```dsl
+dag.strict:
  flowEntry: summarizeAndFix
  steps:
    - id: summarize_draft
      runner: gpt.summarize
      desc: "Summarize blog draft into 3 paragraphs"
    - id: check_logical_gap
      runner: gpt.critic
      depends_on: [summarize_draft]
      desc: "Check logical consistency and identify any gaps"
    - id: fix_flow
      runner: gpt.rewrite
      depends_on: [check_logical_gap]
      desc: "Fill in gaps with coherent transitions"
    - id: compose_final
      runner: gpt.editor
      depends_on: [summarize_draft, fix_flow]
      desc: "Combine summary and fixed content"
  +reason: "Clear role separation per step improves coherence"
  +intuition: "Logical flow often gets lost in summarization"
```

**Simulated GPT Responses:**

```
summarize_draft → "This blog explores GPT orchestration using DSL. Structured steps allow judgment. Recursion builds reflective agents."

check_logical_gap → "The jump from 'structured steps' to 'recursion' lacks bridging explanation."

fix_flow → "Insert: 'Through DSL constructs like +retry and +critic, GPT reenters previous logic paths for reflection.'"

compose_final → "Revised summary includes better narrative flow and connected reasoning."
```

### Matching ASCII Flow

```text
        +-------------------+
        | summarize_draft   |
        |  (gpt.summarize)  |
        +---------+---------+
                  |
                  v
        +---------+---------+
        | check_logical_gap |
        |    (gpt.critic)   |
        +---------+---------+
                  |
                  v
        +---------+---------+
        |   fix_flow        |
        | (gpt.rewrite)     |
        +---------+---------+
                  |
                  v
        +---------+---------+
        | compose_final     |
        |   (gpt.editor)    |
        +-------------------+
```

### Recursive Thought Loop Example (Simplified)

```dsl
+dag.strict:
  flowEntry: recursiveLoop
  steps:
    - id: propose
      runner: gpt.intuition
      desc: "Propose a possible solution"
    - id: evaluate
      runner: gpt.val
      depends_on: [propose]
      desc: "Evaluate confidence of proposed idea"
    - id: reflect
      runner: gpt.critic
      depends_on: [evaluate]
      desc: "Reflect and identify flaws"
    - id: retry_if_low
      runner: gpt.rewrite
      depends_on: [reflect]
      desc: "Refine and retry proposal"
      +retry: "evaluate.output.confidence < 0.5"
  +intuition: "GPT may require several iterations before converging"
  +reason: "Self-improvement through evaluation–reflection loop"
```

**ASCII Flow for Recursive Loop:**

```text
      +-----------+
      | propose   |
      +-----+-----+
            |
            v
      +-----+-----+
      | evaluate  |
      +-----+-----+
            |
      confidence < 0.5?
        /      \
      yes       no
     /            \
    v              v
+--------+     [exit]
| reflect|
+--------+
     |
     v
+--------+
| retry  |
+--------+
     |
     +--→ back to propose
```

## 5. From Prompting to Self-Correcting Reasoning Loops

This isn't prompt engineering. It's **reasoning architecture**:

- Use `+intuition → +val → +critic → +dag → +retry`
- Detect divergence via `@gpt.entropy`
- Let GPT reflect and reenter the flow until it stabilizes

GPT becomes a **thinking agent**, not a fixed tool.

## 6. Prototype System: `gpt_dag_executor-v0.1`

This experimental system was created **without writing a single line of traditional code**. All components were generated via GPT:

- `dag_generator.py`: Parses natural language into DSL
- `dag_executor.py`: Executes structured steps
- `dsl_validator.py`: Validates the DSL
- `condition_eval.py`: Automates condition evaluation
- `dag_autorecover.py`: Manages retries or fallback routes
- `dag_orchestrator.py`: Connects all parts
- `main.py`: Launches the full DAG reasoning pipeline

## 7. Try It Yourself: StarterKit

👉 [GitHub StarterKit](https://github.com/wittgena/gpt-meta-dsl/blob/main/starterkeit/gpt-dag-orchestrator-starterkit-v0.1.md)

- Copy/paste DSL templates  
- Try it with OpenAI Assistants API or LangGraph  
- Start building GPT as a reasoning orchestrator

## 8. What’s Next: Judges, Monitors, and Multi-Phase Reasoning

In Part 2, we’ll explore:
- `+judge`, `+monitor`, `+halt`
- Multi-agent execution in LangGraph
- Phase-based reflection loops with entropy awareness

**GPT starts with a prompt. But it thinks through structure.**
